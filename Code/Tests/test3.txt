No amount of freedom gets you clean.
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes.
I can not see the facts through all of my fury.
She is still twenty-three inside her fantasy.
I had a marvelous time ruining everything.
You drew stars around my scars but now I am bleeding.
They took the crown but it is alright.
He has got my past frozen behind glass.
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme.
I once believed love would be burning red.
You are not my homeland anymore.
He said he liked the way my blue eyes shone.
He was casually cruel in the name of being honest.
You can plan for a change in weather and time.
I am still a believer but I do not know why.
She wears short skirts and I wear t-shirts.
They told me all of my cages were mental.
The road not taken looks real good now.
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires.
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me!
I take this magnetic force of a man.
You held your head like a hero.
When the sun came up you were looking at me.
I did not have it in myself to go with grace.
It never ever occurred to you.
